# Activity-5---Decorators

Write a decorator for a function that accepts a dictionary as a parameter. Add the dictionary {'why':'am I doing this?'} to the parameter and call the decorated function. Once the function has completed its work remove {'why':'am I doing this?'}.

Write a function that prints a dictionary so that:
1. Each key/value pair is printed on it's own line.
2. The keys and values are labeled.

Call the function and decorated function with the dictionary {"1": "two", "buckle": "my shoe", "three": "four", "Python": "drives me batcrap crazy"}.
